    <h2>My Ethos</h2>
    <p>At all times strive to do your best in every situation. Knowing your best may not at all times be truly the best
        choice, but that simply reacting to fear of failure is by far worse than failing in an attempt to do something
        above and beyond what is required. Realize that plans are critical but equally important is knowing plans seldom
        work out in their entirety. Being able to grasp change and move ahead as if it were the original plan is vital
        to being focused on the future yet living in the present. Each day presents a new challenge. It is embracing the
        obstacles of daily living rather than attempting to create a world in which we avoid them that makes life
        rewarding. We fear and plan for the unknown yet in doing so miss out on not only the unknown which we are afraid
        of but also that of which we dream of. Realize the past is nothing more than something that has already
        happened. Never forget where you came from but do not let memories direct your passion. There is always someone
        out there who loves you not for who you believe yourself to be but who you really are. Do not let otherâ€™s
        judgment guide your decisions but instead hold yourself to a firm foundation of values not made of fact and
        science but of passion for living for something greater than yourself. Realize that sometimes a selfish decision
        is exactly the right one. You will never be able to change the world if you cannot do the right thing for
        yourself. You will only be able to sacrifice something you already have. Live first with your heart and your
        mind will not be so clouded by useless reasoning. Listen to others and realize that everyone else in the world
        is living their life with a passion that may be different from yours. Do not judge anyone including yourself.
        When everything in life fails give up all hope and faith you try to muster on your own and allow someone else
        carry that for you. It is a powerful thing when someone else believes in you, allow them to. Love everyone
        without expecting anything in return. You will get hurt, you will lose, and you will have your heart broken. But
        if refuse to ever try you will never succeed. <strong>Live your life.</strong></p>
